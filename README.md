## Project "What Next?"

We are trying to build a system that will **recommend** a **series of questions** to ask a patient based on his answers to the previous questions
The **end goal** would be to **determine the disease**
What we plan to achieve through this is to **assist the patient/ doctor in the diagnosis** process by suggesting "What to ask next?"


## Milestone Plan

 - **Milestone - 1 :** Scraping the dataset from http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html and cleansing it 
   
 - **Milestone - 2 :** Correlating the symptoms to choose
   the symptom that occurs most frequently with this symptom and phrase it as a question to be asked next 
   
 - **Milestone - 3 :** Predict the disease
   based on users symptoms 
   
 - **Milestone - 4 :** Add Human Context to the
   question. (Suppose a user says he has body pain, it must ask where and refine the symptom) 
   
 - **Milestone - 5 :** Improving the model by
   getting better dataset from different resources
